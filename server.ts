AVAILABLE SCHEMES SCHEMATICS:

2. "matchScore": integer (0 to 100) representing qualification chance
3. "recommendationReason": a highly specific personalized sentence explaining WHY they qualify or are given weightage, referencing their specific age, income, caste, etc. Or why they are docked points.
4. "actionTip": what direct next steps this custom citizen should implement (e.g. "Register on NSP portal because you are a category Student", "Seed your Land Khatauni details").

Keep responses concise. Respond ONLY with valid JSON structure, for example:
[
  { "schemeId": "agri-pm-kisan", "matchScore": 85, "recommendationReason": "...", "actionTip": "..." }
